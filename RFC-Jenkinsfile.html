- RFC PR:

 

# Summary

 

One paragraph explanation of the proposal.

- Convert security scanning projects from Jenkins 1.x to Jenkinsfile and use shared scripts.

 

# Motivation

 

Why are we doing this?

- We need to add SourceClear to the Fortify projects so all of the Fortify projects need to be

modified.

- When making SourceClear and Fortify changes to projects it would save time if the projects reused

as much of the code as possible.

- We want to make it easier for SourceClear and Fortify Jenkins jobs to be created by SHIELD and/or

teams.

- We want teams to have more control and visibility over their SourceClear and Fortify jobs,

build/wget steps, NodeJS version, and scan results.

 

What use cases does it support?

- For all EXDG Client repositories that need SourceClear and/or Fortify scans.

 

What is the expected outcome?

- Jenkinsfile projects are easier to create, move to another server, reuse code, and

generate Jenkins jobs.

 

# Detailed design

 

This is the bulk of the RFC. Explain the design in enough detail for somebody

familiar with the project to understand, and for somebody familiar with the

implementation to implement. This should get into specifics and corner-cases,

and include examples of how the feature is used. Any new terminology should be

defined here.

- A `Github Organization` Jenkins pipeline project

https://uslvebld02.am.company.com/job/SourceClear_Fortify_Scans/ is used to scan all org

repositories and look in the master and hammerhead-develop branches for a Jenkinsfile named

security/Jenkinsfile-Security it then creates a Jenkins job for each found. The

SourceClear_Fortify_Scans job is configured to use shared scripts

https://github.org.company.com/org/jenkins-scripts/tree/1.0.0/vars. The

security/Jenkinsfile-Security file imports the shared libraries for SourceClear and Fortify,

and sending email notification.

 

- The template of security/Jenkinsfile-Security is

https://github.org.company.com/org/jenkins-scripts/blob/master/Template-Jenkinsfile-Security

 

- Documentation to setup the Jenkinsfile, and the edge cases, are described in

https://github.org.company.com/org/jenkins-scripts/blob/master/README.md

 

- The Fortify stage calls https://github.org.company.com/org/jenkins-scripts/blob/master/scan.sh

and either a build file `REPOSITORY`/security/get_artifacts.sh is called or wget commands are

  called from https://github.org.company.com/org/jenkins-scripts/blob/master/wget_artifacts.sh

 

# Architectural Impact

 

What names and terminology work best for these concepts and why? How is this

idea best presented? As a continuation of existing architectural patterns, or as a

wholly new one?

- https://uslvebld02.am.company.com/job/SourceClear_Fortify_Scans/ should be referred to as

the parent or orchestration job.

 

# Dependencies and Risks

 

What specific dependencies exist for this RFC?

- We need most of version names for the repositories to be renamed by the ProdSec team to

match their repository name.

- We need teams to merge the security/Jenkinsfile-Security into their master branch.

 

Will this have an impact on existing systems that need alteration?

- The current Fortify projects need to have their parameters copied to the Jenkinsfile

and after testing they should be disabled.

 

# Drawbacks

 

Why should we *not* do this? Please consider the impact on maintainability,

scalability, and the integration of this feature with other existing and planned

features and systems.

- We should not do this if we decide that Jenkins 1.x projects are preferred over Jenkinsfile

 

# Alternatives

 

What other designs have been considered? What is the impact of not doing this?

- Instead of using the README document to manually create `REPOSITORY`/security/Jenkinsfile-Security

  we could have a Jenkins project that prompts the user for information and then it creates a Jenkinsfile

  puts it in github.

- Instead of setting the NodeJS in `REPOSITORY`/security/Jenkinsfile-Security from the Jenkins

  installation use docker image.

- Create sendSlack.groovy to use instead or in addition to

https://github.org.company.com/org/jenkins-scripts/blob/1.0.0/vars/sendEmail.groovy

- apollo-ps4 sets part of its scan directory from a file. Instead we may able to change

the apollo-ps4 build project to create the artifact without the versioned directory structure.

 

# Unresolved questions

 

Optional, but suggested for first drafts. What parts of the design are still TBD?

 

- Is memory still an issue? (Some testing done and it no longer required -Xmx4000M)

- Does pulling down npm/@org/module get built artifact, this could be a good alternative to building the

source for Hawklet and GCT.

- How many projects have minified files? Do we need to get teams to provide unminified artifacts?

- Should Fortify scans skip repo and only scan artifacts?

- Where and how to make the list of NodeJS installations on LV02 available for easy viewing as this would be

useful when setting up `REPOSITORY`/security/Jenkinsfile-Security.
